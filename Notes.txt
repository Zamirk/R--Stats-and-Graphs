First I imported the data from the csv file into a data frame.I then created a list to display the number of null or empty values from each column. I excluded columns which had 0 null or empty values.
In regards to the numerical data, (MINUTES_3MONTHS_AGO, CUST_MOS, TOT_MINUTES_USAGE),
I found the median of each column, then replace the empty values with it. (Appendix 1.2)
For the categorical columns which had missing data, PHONE_PLAN and EDUCATION, I created a function which finds and returns the mode. I used this function to replace the empty values with the mode value. (Appendix 1.3)
I then chose to check for any duplicates, and found none. (Appendix 2.1)

I used the previously created list of empty and null values that I created to get the percentage of empty values per column. I then used the summary function to generate a summary of the data frame and all of the columns. This provided me with the Min, Max, Mean and Median.
I then used the previously created calcualteMode function to get the mode of each predictor variable as necessary. The standard deviation was acquired by using the sd() function on each column. (Appendix 1.3)
To calculate skewness, I use the library e1071. Command used was Skewness ()

To analyses the distribution of each predictor variable. I generated the following graphs which allowed me to study the information in more detail.
